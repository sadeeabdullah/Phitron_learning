PBDS = Policy Based Data Struture

PBDS = SET  + MULTISET

EXTRA FACILITIES(2 XTRA FUNCTIONALITIES):?
1. order_of_key  ---> if you x it will say how many value is strictly less than x in PBDS --->O(log n)
2. find_by_order  ---> it will return the value in any index(yeah we know that we only can iterate on the STL but find_by_order uses iterator but can give you the index value by increasing the iterator in just O(log n) time complexity) 


all functionality of set and MULTISET is available in pbds but erase function for MULTISET is different
HOW?
use set as MULTISET
